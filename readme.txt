Platformer 7/31/2018
A small platformer game I made with simple mechanics. Used this project to help me learn JS/HTML/CSS.

Changelog:
Version 0.5 - First working version of the game. Buggy physics with only the ability to play default levels.
Version 0.5.1 - Added a way to clear data and fixed glitchy collisions.
Version 0.6 - Implemented light jQuery, a few buttons, and a way to pause and restart.


To-Do:
Add new block mechanics.
Level Creator.
Better menu.
Death screen.
Winning screen.
